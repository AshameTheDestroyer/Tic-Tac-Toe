# Tic-Tac-Toe
Simply, my first game made using front-end.

This game had been made way way earlier, like half a year or so, but back then I hadn't been yet into GitHub and other stuff, so it's safe to say, that I feel comfortable to share it now, so I can be free to share my other future games too.
